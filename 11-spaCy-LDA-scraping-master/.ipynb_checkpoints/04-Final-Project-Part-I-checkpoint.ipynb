    "# Final Data Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "For next Monday, you should aim to identify and load a dataset that you will work on for your final project.  This project will involve you exploring this dataset, including using either a classification or regression problem as a modeling component.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset should have the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More than 1000 rows\n",
    "- A mixture of variable types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to acquiring the dataset, you should aim to begin your EDA process.  Be very clear about stating the questions that your code is engaging. Your final product will be a Jupyter notebook and 5 minute in-class presentation.  In advance of this, next Monday plan to introduce your project in 1 minute or less including some visual support."
