But despite the engine-powered efficiency, the mood is far from inhuman: \u201cWorkings of the Inner Circle\u201d brings squelching, soulful chords, while \u201cAll My Heart\u201d is an ecstatic romance running on an 808 throb and oxytocin-laced synths as a voice whispers those three little words, over and over.", "The worship of Detroit techno can spill into fetishization too easily: This idea of a futuristic, sci-fi sound emerging from a post-industrial wasteland verges upon \u201c", "\u201d as we imagine the ghostly clang of machinery pealing through the broken windows of the Packard Plant. But despite its many imitators, it\u2019s hard to argue with the feeling that Detroit techno just sounds best when it comes directly from that lineage.

The \u201cyou\u201d in the song doesn\u2019t even matter. What\u2019s important is the desire itself and her regret over not acting on it.", "The bluntness of Monroe\u2019s lyrics lends depth to the self-portrait she sculpts in these songs, revealing just how much she longs for and cherishes human connection. When she sings about that haunted guitar she inherited from her heroes on closing track \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d she\u2019s suggesting that music in general, and country music in particular, lets us voice our desires or at least accept that they\u2019ll never be satisfied. It\u2019s a fitting coda to the album\u2019s emotional highpoint, \u201cDaddy I Told You.\u201d In a croon lightened by the peacefulness and confidence of an artist who\u2019s spent her entire career building up to this moment, Monroe sings, \u201cDaddy I told you I was gonna fly,\u201d and the orphan becomes a sparrow, figuring out her wings on the way down."]},

Aside from the acoustic outing on \u201cBe My Baby,\u201d every track is built on the same sturdy arrangement of fuzzy guitar licks and shuffling bass and drums. And since Trilling\u2019s lyrics are, at the moment, confined to a limited range of experience, it can make the album, as a whole, feel like one long run on sentence about the intricacies young love.", "Still, there is a vigor to their music that\u2019s not just accomplished, but deeper than they might know. The band inhabits a space that can feel bigger than the sprawling tree-lined streets and byzantine freeways of their local inspiration. Instead, the place Trilling and her bandmates create is more personal, messier, and chaotic. They give musical cues to the growing pains of young adulthood that are relatable but never trite\u2014their songs, like any you might\u2019ve been obsessed with in high school, feel like a mirror held up to the all-consuming triumphs and heartbreaks of your own youth."]},

In the past, Vessey\u2019s anxiety raps filled his music with unresolvable tension. Even when joking or outright trolling, he could come across as grave.

Instead of rapping inside the crags and pockets of this teeming morass, Vessey orbits around it, using its warmth to forge his own rhythms, like a planet fostering life from a star\u2019s light. Midway through the record, Vessey floats off entirely. The second volume is a rap-less, self-produced beat tape. Relative to Earl and Knxwledge, Vessey\u2019s compositions are airy and porous; the drums strike cleanly, the samples breathe. His beats can jitter just as much as his raps, but the effect is similarly cathartic. \u201cHalal Avocado Toast\u201d shifts from a breezy tropical swing to a snappy bounce without fuss. \u201cQuiet Storm Jam\u201d casually hops from bass-heavy thump to a caramelized sample of Wendy Rene\u2019s \u201cAfter Laughter.\u201d No beat goes unheard.", "The persistent aloofness of ", " sometimes blurs into triviality.

On \u201cFRIENDS,\u201d he confesses to his dependence on weed before calling out specific friends who abuse drugs; in asking them to stop, he mostly ditches his sanctimony.

Listeners are asked to think about the rapper\u2019s pain, rather than his mother\u2019s.", "Kay has encouraged her younger son to use her struggles as a warning to others, which he has done in the past. But there\u2019s more to her story. She worked hard raising two sons by herself, working as a mail carrier to the point where her feet ached. One of those sons became a successful rapper, bought her a house, granted her the opportunity to stop carrying mail and to pursue acting, to meet Barack Obama and Afeni Shakur.

It would be easy to get bogged down in these subjects, to give up, to make the album a monument to despair. Instead, Plunkett finds momentum in her songs, as if naming and dissecting the finer points of loving people somehow lifted its weight. There comes a point where you realize that devoting yourself to someone will lead to the suffering of one kind or another, and yet you surrender to it anyway.

When he returned home he assembled the group that would become ", ", and their story is one of the greatest in rock. They helped invent punk and new wave, and they broke up before they ever released a record. Their brilliant self-titled debut, cobbled together from demos and issued in 1976, is acclaimed as one of the best albums ever.", "What happened immediately afterward is another great rock story: Just as the Modern Lovers\u2019 belated popularity was cresting on the punk wave, Richman formed a new version of the group and pushed it in a different direction, with prominent acoustic guitar and what seemed like songs for children. By 1978, Richman and these Modern Lovers had parted ways, too, and here\u2019s where some accounts of Richman\u2019s decades-long career lose the thread. But he actually had some of his very best work in front of him.", "More than 40 years on, what happened ", " the Modern Lovers\u2019 rise and fall might turn out to be the best Richman story of them all. He used his kid-friendly ditties from the late \u201970s to hone in on a not-so-humble goal: to really connect with an audience by just singing what he felt. \u201cPeople think that what I do can\u2019t be done because it\u2019s too simple,\u201d Richman told art critic Kristine McKenna in 1980. \u201cA lot of people think I\u2019m being sarcastic.

His fourth solo album, 1992\u2019s ", ", is his defining recorded statement as a solo artist, and it offers a natural entry point into his scattered but rewarding catalog.", "The albums Richman had released in the \u201980s and early \u201990s had already gone a long way to challenge the widespread impression that his post-", " music was innocent or naive. His lyrics could be plainspoken or filled with wry wonder, but his best songs might be about standing up to nosy neighbors, say, or retaining individuality during marriage. In keeping with the improvisational, no-setlist nature of his live shows, Richman began to rework songs across multiple albums. He would also sing in different languages, dust off unexpected covers, and throw in the occasional moody instrumental. The approach to recording might vary, but the basic sensibility was strummy garage-pop with hints of surf, rockabilly, and doo-wop.

It\u2019s a feeling that hasn\u2019t aged much in the 26 years since it was recorded.", " is full of these transformations, where something old starts to look new through Richman\u2019s wise, wide eyes.

VU\u2019s \u201cSister Ray\u201d is, famously, a 15-minute feedback dirge with lyrics about injecting heroin and sucking on someone\u2019s ding-dong, and it\u2019s also the song that influenced a teenage Richman to write the chugging guitar part to the most enduring Modern Lovers song, the nervy highway anthem \u201cRoadrunner.\u201d In \u201cVelvet Underground,\u201d he celebrates the band for being not only wild and free, but also for creating their own unmistakable atmosphere, and for describing the world they saw vividly without flinching.
